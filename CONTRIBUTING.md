### How To Contribute

Before you start working on a translation, look through the open pull requests to see if anyone else is already working on one for your language.

_NOTE: When translating compare the language with [app.radarrelay.com](http://app.radarrelay.com) for context._

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch for your translation work e.g. `es`.
3. Copy `languages/en.js` to your target language file e.g. `languages/es.js`
4. Translate all the strings.
5. Commit your changes
6. Create a pull request which includes the following information:
 * Language full name
 * Language code
 * Your language proficiency: e.g. _Native_, _Business Level_, or _Conversational_.
